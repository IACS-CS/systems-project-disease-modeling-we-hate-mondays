/* Update this code to simulate a simple disease model! */

/* For this simulation, let's consider a simple disease that spreads through contact.
You can implement a simple model which does one of the following:

1. Model the different effects of different numbers of contacts: in my Handshake Model, two people are in
   contact each round. What happens if you put three people in contact? Four? Five? Consider different options
   such as always putting people in contact with the people "next" to them (i.e. the people before or after them
   in line) or randomly selecting people to be in contact (just do one of these for your model).

2. Take the "handshake" simulation code as your model, but make it so you can recover from the disease. How does the
   spread of the disease change when you set people to recover after a set number of days.

3. Add a "quarantine" percentage to the handshake model: if a person is infected, they have a chance of being quarantined
   and not interacting with others in each round.

/**
 * What we are simulating:
 * We're trying to simulate the increasing and decreasing of people who are infected.
 * 
 * What elements we have to add:
 * We're adding emojis for skull (death), sick (infected), sneezing (getting infected), baby (young), and elder (high-risk) people.
 * 
 * The skull emoji will represent death.
 * The sick emoji will represent infected people.
 * The sneezing emoji will represent people who are getting infected.
 * The baby emoji represents the young kids, who are less likely to be affected severely.
 * The elder emoji represents older individuals who are at high risk of being infected and dying.
 * 
 * In plain language, what our model does:
 * We're simulating the spread of a disease, tracking who gets sick, who dies, and who recovers.
 * We can increase the chances of infection and death to test the model's behavior.
