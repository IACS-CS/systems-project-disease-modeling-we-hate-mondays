/* Update this code to simulate a simple disease model! */

/* For this simulation, let's consider a simple disease that spreads through contact.
You can implement a simple model which does one of the following:

1. Model the different effects of different numbers of contacts: in my Handshake Model, two people are in
   contact each round. What happens if you put three people in contact? Four? Five? Consider different options
   such as always putting people in contact with the people "next" to them (i.e. the people before or after them
   in line) or randomly selecting people to be in contact (just do one of these for your model).

2. Take the "handshake" simulation code as your model, but make it so you can recover from the disease. How does the
spread of the disease change when you set people to recover after a set number of days.

3. Add a "quarantine" percentage to the handshake model: if a person is infected, they have a chance of being quarantined
and not interacting with others in each round.

 * Authors: Chery and Aditya
 *
 * What we are simulating:
 * we're trying to simulate the increasing and decreasing of people who are infected
 *
 * What elements we have to add:
 * we're adding emojis skull, sick, sneezing, baby emoji, and happy emoji altogether
 *
 * The skull emoji will represent death
 * The sick emoji will represent the people who are infected already
 * The sneezing emoji will represent the people who are getting infected
 * The baby emoji represents the young kids in the pandemic
 * The old lady emoji represents the elders who are at high risk for getting COVID
 *
 * In plain language, what our model does:
 * We're going to create a simulation of people that are going through the pandemic
 * We will observe who gets sick, who dies, and who is immune to COVID
 * We can increase the chances of death and infection to test the limits and see the results we're aiming for.
 *
 * Credits:
 * Chery and Aditya
 * Used Github Copilot to help with the code throughout.
 * Worked with Mr. Hinkle to understand how to add variable
 * death rates for different ages.
